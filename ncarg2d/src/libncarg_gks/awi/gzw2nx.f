      SUBROUTINE GZW2NX(N,P,Q)
C
C  This subroutine takes the N points in the real array P,
C  which are assumed to be in world coordinates, and, using
C  the current normalization transformation, converts them
C  into NDC coordinates and stores them in Q.  This subroutine 
C  operates on X-coordinates.
