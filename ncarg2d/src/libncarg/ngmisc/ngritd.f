C Define a multiplicative constant to convert from degrees to radians.

C
C This routine rotates the point with coordinates (UCRD,VCRD,WCRD) by
C the angle ANGL about the axis specified by IAXS (1 for the U axis,
C 2 for the V axis, 3 for the W axis).  A right-handed coordinate
C system is assumed.
