      SUBROUTINE CPSCAE (ICRA,ICA1,ICAM,ICAN,XCPF,YCPF,XCQF,YCQF,
     +                                       IND1,IND2,ICAF,IAID)
      DIMENSION ICRA(ICA1,*)
C
C This routine is called by CPCICA when the internal parameter 'CAF' is
C given a negative value.  Each call is intended to update a particular
C element in the user's cell array.  The arguments are as follows:
C
C ICRA is the user's cell array.
C
C ICA1 is the first dimension of the FORTRAN array ICRA.
C
C ICAM and ICAN are the first and second dimensions of the cell array
C stored in ICRA.
C
C (XCPF,YCPF) is the point at that corner of the rectangular area
C into which the cell array maps that corresponds to the cell (1,1).
C The coordinates are given in the fractional coordinate system (unlike
C what is required in a call to GCA, in which the coordinates of the
C point P are in the world coordinate system).
C
C (XCQF,YCQF) is the point at that corner of the rectangular area into
C which the cell array maps that corresponds to the cell (ICAM,ICAN).
C The coordinates are given in the fractional coordinate system (unlike
C what is required in a call to GCA, in which the coordinates of the
C point Q are in the world coordinate system).
C
C IND1 is the 1st index of the cell that is to be updated.
C
C IND2 is the 2nd index of the cell that is to be updated.
C
C ICAF is the current value of the internal parameter 'CAF'.  This
C value will always be an integer which is less than zero (because
C when 'CAF' is zero or greater, this routine is not called).
C
C IAID is the area identifier associated with the cell.  It will have
C been given one of the values from the internal parameter array 'AIA'
C (the one for 'PAI' = -2 if the cell lies in a special-value area, the
C one for 'PAI' = -1 if the cell lies off the data grid, or the one for
C some value of 'PAI' between 1 and 'NCL' if the cell lies on the data
C grid).  The value zero may occur if the cell falls in a special-value
C area and the value of 'AIA' for 'PAI' = -2 is 0 or if the cell lies
C off the data grid and the value of 'AIA' for 'PAI' = -1 is 0, or
C if the cell falls on the data grid, but no contour level below the
C cell has a non-zero 'AIA' and no contour level above the cell has a
C non-zero 'AIB'.  Note that, if the values of 'AIA' for 'PAI' = -1
C and -2 are given non-zero values, IAID can only be given a zero
C value in one way.
C
C The default behavior of CPSCAE is as follows:  If the area identifier
C is non-negative, it is treated as a color index, to be stored in the
C appropriate cell in the cell array, but if the area identifier is
C negative, the cell array is simply not changed.  The user may supply
C a version of CPSCAE that does something different; it may simply map
C the area identifiers into color indices or it may somehow modify the
C existing cell array element to incorporate the information provided
C by the area identifier.
C
      IF (IAID.GE.0) ICRA(IND1,IND2)=IAID
C
      RETURN
C
      END
