      SUBROUTINE SFSETC (CNP,CVP)
C
      CHARACTER*(*) CNP,CVP
C
C This subroutine is called to give a character value to a specified
C parameter.
C
C CNP is the name of the parameter whose value is to be set.
C
C CVP is a character variable containing the desired value.
C
C
C Declare the labeled common block.

C
C Declare the block data routine external to force its loading.
C
      EXTERNAL SFBLDA
C
C Declare a local character variable in which to form an error message.
C
      CHARACTER*38 CTM
C
C Check for an uncleared prior error.
C
      IF (ICFELL('SFSETC - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR',1).NE.0) RETURN
C
C Check for a parameter name that is too short.
