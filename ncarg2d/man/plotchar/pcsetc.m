.SH NAME
PCSETC -  
Gives a new character value to a specified internal parameter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
CALL PCSETC (PNAM,CVAL)
.SH C-BINDING SYNOPSIS
#include <ncarg/ncargC.h>
.sp
void c_pcsetc (char *pnam, char *cval)
.SH DESCRIPTION 
.IP PNAM 12
(an input constant or variable of type CHARACTER) specifies the name of the
parameter to be set. The name must appear as the first two
characters of the string. If the internal parameter is one
of the two (\'BC\' and \'CC\') that are arrays, the index of
the desired array element may appear, enclosed in
parentheses, in columns 3 and following. Other characters
may be used to document the use of the parameter being
retrieved; for example, instead of just \'MA\', one can use
\'MA - MAPPING FLAG\' and, instead of \'CC(10)\', one can use
\'CC(10) - SPECIAL COLOR 10\'.
.IP CVAL 12 
(an input constant or variable of type CHARACTER)
is the value to be assigned to the
internal parameter specified by PNAM. 
.SH C-BINDING DESCRIPTION
The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN 
argument descriptions.
.SH USAGE
