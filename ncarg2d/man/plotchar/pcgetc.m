.SH NAME
PCGETC -  
Retrieves the current character value of an internal parameter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
CALL PCGETC (PNAM,CVAL)
.SH C-BINDING SYNOPSIS
#include <ncarg/ncargC.h>
.sp
void c_pcgetc (char *pnam, char *cval, int len)
.SH DESCRIPTION 
.IP PNAM 12
(an input constant or variable of type CHARACTER) specifies the name of the
parameter to get. The name must appear as the first two
characters of the string. If the internal parameter is one
of the two (\'BC\' and \'CC\') that are arrays, the index of
the desired array element may appear, enclosed in
parentheses, in columns 3 and following. Other characters
may be used to document the use of the parameter being
retrieved; for example, instead of just \'MA\', one can use
\'MA - MAPPING FLAG\' and, instead of \'CC(10)\', one can use
\'CC(10) - SPECIAL COLOR 10\'.
.IP CVAL 12
(an output variable of type CHARACTER) is the name of the variable
into which the value of the internal parameter specified by PNAM
is to be retrieved.
.SH C-BINDING DESCRIPTION
The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN 
argument descriptions with the following exception:
.IP len 12
The size of cval as dimensioned in the calling program.
.SH USAGE
This routine allows you to retrieve the current value of
Plotchar parameters.  For a complete list of parameters available
in this utility, see the plotchar_params man page.
.SH ACCESS
To use PCGETC or c_pcgetc, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks,
and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.  
.SH MESSAGES
See the plotchar man page for a description of all Plotchar error
messages and/or informational messages.
