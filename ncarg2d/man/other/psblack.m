.SH NAME
psblack \- PostScript filter.

.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B psblack
is a filter which reads a PostScript file as input
and writes a PostScript file as output.  In
the output file the filter forces a black background
and scales the intensity values (values with
R=G=B) so that any intensity greater than or equal
to .8 is mapped to white.  
This filter works only
on PostScript files produced by ctrans - the CGM translator
in the NCAR Graphics software.
