.SH NAME
pswhite \- PostScript filter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pswhite

.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pswhite
is a filter which reads a PostScript file as input
and writes a PostScript file as output.  In
the output file the filter forces a white background
and complements the intensity values (values with
R=G=B) so that the default white foreground
appears as black on the white background.  
This filter works only
on PostScript files produced by ctrans - the CGM translator
in the NCAR Graphics software.
