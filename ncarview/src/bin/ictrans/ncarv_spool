#
#		ictrans sample spooler configuration file
#
#	There are three ':' separated fields in this file: the alias field, 
#	which is simply
#	a name used to refer to a particular printer; the ictrans argument
#	filed; and a list of '|' separted filters which receive input from 
#	ctrans. The '>' symbol may be used in the last field to direct output
#	from the last filter to a file. Also note that a '#' is used to start
#	a comment line like this one.
