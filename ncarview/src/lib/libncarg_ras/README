Parallax
--------
Compiling parallax.c with the Sun "acc" compiler results in problems
with ioctl()'s and /usr/include/sys/ioccom.h, which is not
ANSI-compatible.

HDF
---
The new driver is built upon HDF3.2r1.  The HDF driver needs to have
updated error messages, both internally and in error.h. 24-bit imagery
does not yet appear to work properly.

SGI
---
Support for compressed and uncompressed SGI image input is provided but
output is not in yet.

A60
---
Support for input and output of Abekas RGB images is provided. YUV
images are not yet supported.
