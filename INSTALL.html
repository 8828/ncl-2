<h1>How to build NCL and NCAR Graphics from source code</h1>

NCL and NCAR Graphics can only be built on UNIX systems.  This
software has been successfully built using native compilers on Suns,
SGIs (32 or 64-bit mode), IBMs running AIX (32 or 64-bit), HPs, and
Compaq Alphas, and using other compilers (GNU, Portland Group, Intel,
Pathscale, Lahey) on systems running Linux (32 or 64-bit), MacOSX (PPC
or Intel), Cygwin, and Solaris X86.
<p>

This document is meant to be an all-encompassing document on how to
set up your environment to build NCL and NCAR Graphics, what external
software packages you need and which are optional, and finally how
to build and test NCL and NCAR Graphics.
<p>

<blockquote>
<b>Note on building NCAR Graphics only:</b><p>

You do have the option during the build process to indicate you do not
want to build NCL, effectively building just NCAR Graphics.  This
simplifies the build somewhat, since you can get by with not having to
install most, if any, of the external software packages listed below.
<p>

If you are already familiar with building NCAR Graphics from
source code, then all the instructions you know from before are the
same. The one difference is that when you run "./Configure", be sure
to answer "no" when it asks whether you want to build NCL.
</blockquote>
<p>

This is a new venture for us, so please <a
href="http://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/listinfo/ncl-talk">email
ncl-talk@ucar.edu</a> if you have any problems understanding this
document or building any of this software.

<A NAME="SetupBuildEnvironment"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Set up and test build environment for NCL</H2>
<p>

<A NAME="CompilersNeeded"></A>
<b>Compilers needed to build NCL</b><p>

You need a Fortran 77 or 90 compiler and an ANSI C compiler to build
NCL. If your system has native Fortran and C compilers (for example
"xlf" on IBM/AIX systems), we recommend using these. In addition to
native compilers, NCL has been successfully built with a wide-range of
compilers including <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/fortran/fortran.html">g77</a>, <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran">gfortran</a>, <a
href="http://g95.org/">g95</a>, Intel <a
href="http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/282048.htm">Fortran</a>
and <a
href="http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/284132.htm">C</a>, <a href="http://www.pgroup.com/">Portland Group</a>.
<p>

<A NAME="TestBlockdataInit"></A>
<b>Test that your Fortran compiler does blockdata initializations
correctly</b><p>

The NCL code depends heavily on Fortran blockdata variables
being initialized correctly. We have found that some Fortran compilers
don't handle blockdata initializations correctly, and hence can't
be used to build NCL.
<p>

To test if your Fortran compiler handles blockdata initializations
correctly, download the small <a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/files/blockdata_test.tar">blockdata_test.tar</a>
tar file, and untar it with:

<pre>
  tar -xvf blockdata_test.tar
</pre>

Cd to "blockdata_test" and edit the "Makefile" to change "g77" to
whatever compiler you are using. Then, type:

<pre>
  make main.good main.bad main.init
  ./main.good
  ./main.init
  ./main.bad
</pre>

If the "main.bad" and "main.init" programs give you the output:

<pre>
  TESTSUB: WK =  0...it should be 20
</pre>

then your compiler doesn't handle blockdata initializations
correctly, and you won't be able to use this Fortran compiler
to build NCL.
<p>

If "main.init" gives you the correct output, but "main.bad" doesn't,
then you will be able to use this compiler, but you will need to
include the special options "-ncarbd" and "-ngmathbd" if you compile
an NCAR Graphics or HLU C or Fortran program using "ncargf77",
"ncargf90", "ncargcc", "nhlf77", "nhlf90", and/or "nhlcc".
<p>

<A NAME="X11Libs"></A>
<b>Install X11 libraries and include files needed</b><p>

In order to build some of the X applications that are part of NCL
(like <a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Tools/idt.shtml">idt</a>), you
must have some of the X11 libraries installed on your system. At a
minimum, you should have the following libraries (and associated
include files) installed on your system: X11, Xaw, Xext, Xm, Xmu, Xt.
<p>

These libraries are usually installed as part of an X developer's
package, and will reside in a directory like /usr/X11R6/lib.<P>

<A NAME="BuildNonOptionalSoftware"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Download and build non-optional external software</H2>
<p>

The software listed below is not optional if you plan to build NCL.
If you are building NCARG only, then you only need to build and
install <A HREF="#HDF-4">HDF-4</A>.

<blockquote>

<i>Once you download and install any external software to use with
NCL, you must comply with the license of that software, regardless of
what NCL's license is.</i>

</blockquote>

<p>

<b>Note:</b> it makes things easier if you install all of the external
software needed (with the exception of the X11 libraries and include
files) to the same parent directory.  This will be important later
when you have to tell the NCL build system where all the external
software has been installed. We will use <i>/usr/local</i> in all of
our examples below for installing external software.
<p>

If you want to build NCAR Graphics only, then you only need to build
and install HDF 4, and even this is optional unless you need HDF
support in <a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Tools/ctrans.shtml">ctrans</a>,
<a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Tools/ictrans.shtml">ictrans</a>,
and <a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Tools/idt.shtml">idt</a>.
<p>

<ul>

<A NAME="NetCDF3"></A>
<li><a
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF-3</a> - not
needed if you are only doing an NCARG build.<p>

Download version 3.6.1 or later. (Do not download version 4.x.x.)
<p>

Once you have the netCDF source code, you can build and install it
with:

<pre>
  cd netcdf-3.6.2
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make all install
</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="JPEG"></A>
<li><a href="http://www.ijg.org/">JPEG</a> - not
needed if you are only doing an NCARG build.<p>

Download version 6b or later.
<p>

Once you have the jpeg source code, you can build and install it
with:

<pre>
  cd jpeg-6b
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make all install install-lib install-headers
</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="ZLIB"></A>
<li><a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> -  not
needed if you are only doing an NCARG build.<p>

Download version 1.2.3 or later.
<p>

Once you have the zlib source code, you can build and install it
with:

<pre>
  cd zlib-1.2.3
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make all install
</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="HDF-4"></A>
<li><a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/products/hdf4/">HDF-4</a> -
Download version 4.1 or later (do not download version 5.<i>x.y</i>).
<p>

Once you have the HDF source code, set the environment variable CFLAGS
to -DHAVE_NETCDF. For example:

<pre>
  export CFLAGS=-DHAVE_NETCDF
</pre>

or 

<pre>
  setenv CFLAGS -DHAVE_NETCDF
</pre>

You can then build and install HDF-4 with:

<pre>
  cd HDF4.2r1
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-zlib=/usr/local \
       --with-jpeg=/usr/local --includedir=/usr/local/include/hdf
  make all install
</pre>

The paths used for the "--with-zlib" and "--with-jpeg" options must be
set to whatever you used above for these two software packages.
<p>

Normally the HDF include files would get installed to
/usr/local/include.  Since this will cause some netCDF include files
to get overwritten, you <i>must</i> use the "--includedir" option to
install the HDF include files to an "hdf" subdirectory.

</ul>
<p>

<A NAME="BuildOptionalSoftware"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Download and build optional external software, if needed</H2>
<p>

None of this software is needed if you are only building NCARG.
<p>

Again, as with the above section, it makes things easier if you
install all of the external software needed to the same parent
directory.  We will use <i>/usr/local</i> in all of our examples below
for installing external software.
<p>


<p>
<A NAME="GRIB2"></A>
<b>GRIB2 software</b> - not needed if you are only doing an NCARG
build.<p>

If you need support for reading <a
href="http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/grib2/grib2_doc.shtml">GRIB2</a>
files, then you will need to download and install the following
packages:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/">Jasper</a> -
Download version 1.900 or later.
<p>

Once you have the Jasper source code, you can build and install it
with:

<pre>
  cd jasper-1.900.1
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make all install
</pre>
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/codes/GRIB2/">g2clib</a>
- Download version 1.0.4 or later. There's a bug in version 1.0.4, so
additionally download a modified version of the file "<a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/files/g2_unpack2.c">g2_unpack2.c</a>"
and put it in the "g2clib-1.0.4" directory.  If you download a
different version of g2clib, be sure you incorporate the changed
g2_unpack2.c file, rather than just copying it over.
<p>

Once you have the g2clib source code and the modified file, make
changes to "makefile" to:

<ol>

<li>change the compiler (CC line) and flags (CFLAGS lines)

<li>set the DEFS line to just "-DUSE_JPEG2000" (remove -DUSE_PNG)

<li>add the appropriate location of the Jasper include files to the
INC line

</ol>
<p>

Now type:

<pre>
  make all install
  cp libgrib2c.a /usr/local/lib
  cp grib2.h" /usr/local/include
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
<p>

<A NAME="HDFEOS2"></A>
<b>HDF-EOS 2 software</b>  - not needed if you are only doing an NCARG
build.<p>

If you need support for reading <a
href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdfeos.html">HDF-EOS 2</a> files, then you
will need to download and install the following packages:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hdfeos.org/software/">HDFEOS 2</a> - Download
version 2.14.v1 or later.
<p>

<pre>
  cd HDF-EOS2.14v1.00
  bin/INSTALL-HDFEOS
</pre>
<p>

Answer questions about location of HDF-4 lib and include files. You
must include "hdf" subdir for include directory (for example,
"/usr/local/include/hdf").
<p>

Pay attention to where "libhdfeos.a" file gets installed under the
hdfeos/lib directory, and move this file to where you are installing
other libraries.  Do <b>not</b> move libGctp.a!  Cd to ../../include and
<b>copy</b> all of the files there to the approriate include
(/usr/local/include) directory.
<p>

<li><a href="http://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub//software/gctpc/">gctp</a>
- Download latest version available.
<p>

<pre>
  cd gctp/src
</pre>

Copy appropriate make<i>xxxx</i> file to "makefile", edit as
necessary, and be sure to change LIBDIR appropriately
(/usr/local/lib).

Then type:

<pre>
  make all install
</pre>
<p>

</ul>

<A NAME="NetCDF4"></A>
<b>NetCDF-4 software</b> - not needed if you are only doing an NCARG
build.<p>

If you need support for reading/writing classic <a
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf-4/">NetCDF-4</a>
files, then you will need to download and install the following
packages:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.compressconsult.com/szip/">szip</a> - Download
version 2.0 or later.
<p>

<pre>
  cd szip-2.0

<p>

<A NAME="Triangle"></A>
<b>Triangle software</b>  - not needed if you are only doing an NCARG
build.<p>

If you need to use the <a

(for generating <a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/trimesh.shtml">triangular
meshes that you can contour</a>), then you will need to download the
source code, and copy over
<i>only the files</i> "triangle.c" and "triangle.h" to the
$NCL/ni/src/lib/hlu directory in the NCL source tree (you may not have
downloaded the NCL source code yet, so wait until you get to this part
to copy over the two files).
<p>

Note that Triangle has a more restrictive license than NCL's license
which disallows you from selling any source code or product that
contains Triangle.  If you build NCL with Triangle included, you will
be bound by Triangle's license.
<p>


<A NAME="OPeNDAP"></A>
<b>OPeNDAP software</b> - not needed if you are only doing an NCARG
build.<p>

If you need OPeNDAP support built into NCL for accessing remote data,
then you'll need to download and install the following packages.  OPeNDAP
requires SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) libraries, which may or may not already
be installed on your host.

<UL>
<li><a href="http://www.openssl.org">Open SSL</a>
<p>
Download version 0.9.8e or later.  Once you have the source code, you can

To download the NCL source code, follow the instructions at the URL:

<B>
<A HREF="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/">http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/</A>
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The NCL source code you download will be a single compressed tar
file (we'll call it "ncl_ncarg_src-5.0.0.tar.gz"). Move the
"ncl_ncarg_src-5.0.0.tar.gz" file to a temporary directory where you
have plenty of disk space (around 250 megabytes to hold all of the
source code, object files, binaries, and so on). Then, uncompress and
untar the file as follows:<P>

<pre>
  gunzip ncl_ncarg_src-5.0.0.tar.gz
  tar -xvf ncl_ncarg_src-5.0.0.tar
</pre>

The above steps will create a directory called "ncl_ncarg-5.0.0".  For
convenience, we'll use the notation $NCARG to mean the top level of
the NCL/NCAR Graphics source tree. Set the environment variable NCARG
to the full path of this directory.

For example, if you untarred the files from the directory
/usr/local/src, then you would do the following:

<pre>
  setenv NCARG /usr/local/src/ncl_ncarg-5.0.0
</pre>

or 

<pre>
  export NCARG=/usr/local/src/ncl_ncarg-5.0.0

<LI><b>Test if your system is recognized by NCL build environment</b>
<p>

Before you try to build NCL, you need to quickly check if your system
will be recognized by the NCL build environment. Type:

<pre>
  cd $NCARG/config
  ./ymake
</pre>
<p>

If no output is echoed to the screen, then go to the next section on
<a href="#GetConfigFileName">getting your configuration file
name</a>. Otherwise, go to <a href="#AppendixA">Appendix A</A> for
information on modifying your system configuration files so they
recognize your system.
<p>

<A NAME="GetConfigFileName"></A>
<LI><b>Get name of configuration file</b>
<p>

If no output is echoed to the screen, then this most likely means that
the NCL build environment recognizes your system.  You can then get
the name of your configuration file by typing (in the same directory):

<pre>
  grep SYSTEM_INCLUDE Makefile
</pre>

This should echo something like:

<pre>
SYSTEM_INCLUDE          = "Darwin"
</pre>

which means "Darwin" is the name of the configuration file it will
use in the $NCARG/config directory.
<p>

<A NAME="ModifySystemConfigFile"></A>
<li><b>Modify system configuration file to change default values</b>
<p>

Once you've run "./Configure" and it successfully recognizes your
system, you can type:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
cd $NCARG<BR>
make Info
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

to make sure your configuration is set up properly.  The "make Info"
command will report the installation directories, what C and
Fortran compilers are being used, and what options to the compilers
are being set. The name of the system configuration file being used
will also appear on the line that starts with "System File".<P>

If you need to change the compilers or the options used, then modify
the file "$NCARG/config/<I>system_file</I>", where <I>system_file</I>
is the system configuration file being used.

In particular, you may want to pay attention to how the following
macros are being set:<P>

<PRE>
    CCompiler
    FCompiler
    ExtraSysLibraries
    CcOptions
    FcOptions
    NgCallF
</PRE>

and change them as desired. <P>

If you don't see these macros being defined in your system
configuration file, then that means that the default value, which is
defined in the $NCARG/config/Template file, is being used. To
change the default, just add it to your system configuration file with
the new value.<P>

For example, on Sun systems, the default "f77" compiler is used. If
you want to change this to "g77", then modify the file
$NCARG/config/Sun4Solaris, and add the line:<P>

<PRE>
#define FCompiler  g77

along with the other macro definitions.

<HR>
<H2>Run Configure script</H2>
<p>

Before you build and install NCL, you need to run a script called
"Configure" to answer several questions about where you want
the software installed, what optional software you want to include,
and the location of the optional software.
<p>

Enter the following commands to run this script (you must be running
csh):<P>

<pre>
  cd $NCARG
  ./Configure  -v
</pre>

If Configure doesn't recognize your system, it will quit right
away with an error message. Otherwise, it will start asking you
several questions.<P>

If it quits with an error message that indicates it doesn't recognize
your system, then read and follow the instructions in the section on
<a href="#TestIfSystemRecognized">testing if your system is recognized
by the NCL build environment</a> before running Configure again.
<p>

If Configure does recognize your system, then answer all of the
questions about where you want the software installed, whether you
want to use a Fortran 90 compiler, whether you want X11 support and/or
HDF support, and so on.
<p>

Once you have finished running Configure, you should get a message
indicating that the configuration process is complete, and that you
can start building and installing the software.

First verify that you have the correct compilers, options, and paths
by typing:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>make  Info</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

If everything looks okay, then you can skip the next few sections and
go directly to "<A HREF="#StartBuildAndInstall">Start the build and
install process</A>."<P>

If the installation paths look wrong, then rerun Configure and reenter
the installation paths. <P>

If something else looks wrong, like the name of the compilers or the
compiler options listed, then go to the section "<A
HREF="#ModifySystemConfigFile">Modify system configuration file to
change default values</A>."
<P>

<A NAME="AIX"></A>
<B>Special note for AIX systems</B><P>

If you are going to build on an AIX system, then you need to decide if
you want to build using the 32-bit option (-q32) or the 64-bit option
(-q64). The AIX configuration file is set up to use whatever the
default is on your system.  If you want to compile using a specific
precision, then copy the appropriate
<B>$NCARG/config/AIX_RS6000.<I>xx</I></B> file to
<B>$NCARG/config/AIX_RS6000</B>, and make any necessary changes.<P>

You can also setenv the OBJECT_MODE environment variable to 64 or 32,
and this will build in that precision without having to set any
compiler options.<P>

<A NAME="IRIX"></A>
<B>Special note for IRIX systems</B><P>

If you are going to build on an IRIX system, then you need to decide
if you want to build using the 32-bit option (-n32) or the 64-bit
option (-64). The configuration file is set up to use whatever the
default is on your systemm.  If you want to compile using a specific
precision, then copy the appropriate
<B>$NCARG/config/SGI_IRIX.<I>xx</I></B> file to
<B>$NCARG/config/SGI_IRIX</B>, and make any necessary changes.<P>

<A NAME="Linux"></A>
<B>Special note for Linux systems</B><P>

The default configuration file for Linux assumes you have a 32-bit
architecture and are using the GNU compilers (gcc and g77). If you
have a different compiler or architecture (i.e. 64-bit) you want to
use, you need to copy the appropriate
$NCARG/config/LINUX.<I>xxx</I> file to $NCARG/config/LINUX. Some of
the available configuration files include:

<OL>
<LI>LINUX.GNU - GNU compilers (32-bit architecture)<P>
<LI>LINUX.64.GNU - GNU compilers (64-bit architecture)<P>
<LI>LINUX.PGI - Portland Group compilers (32-bit architecture)<P>

</OL>

<A NAME="MacOSX"></A>
<B>Special note for MacOSX systems</B><P>

To build NCL on an MacOSX system, you must first install
a few supplemental packages:

<OL>
<LI>MacOSX Developer Tools<P>
  
If you have a "/Developers/Tools" directory, cd to that directory and
search for a PDF file that will contain instructions on how to install
the Developer's Tools.<P>

Also, the developer's tools may be on a CD that you received with
your Mac.<P>

If you don't have the directory or the CD, you can get the Developer's
Tools from the <A
HREF="http://connect.apple.com">http://connect.apple.com</A>
site. (You may need to create an account with them first.)  Once you
are logged in, click on "Download Software", and then "Mac OS X". You
should then see a link for downloading the Developer's Tools.<P>

<LI>fink<P>

Fink is a must-have application for MacOSX users. In the words of the
fink developers, fink "makes existing Open Source software easily
available to casual users as a coherent, comfortable distribution that
matches what Linux users are used to". (In this case, fink will be
used to install the next required package, g77.)<P>

To install fink, go to:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A
HREF="http://fink.sourceforge.net">http://fink.sourceforge.net</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

and click on "Download" on the left. Follow the instructions under
"Quick Start".  Basically, you just download the binary installer that
they have a link to, and then click on the resultant
"Fink-<I>x.x.x</I>-Installer.dmg" file that should have appeared on
your Mac desktop window.  Follow the rest of the instructions to make
sure your fink environment is set up correctly.<P>

Be sure to run:

<PRE>
    fink selfupdate-cvs
</PRE>

to make sure all of the packages are up to date.<P>


<LI>GNU fortran 77 compiler (g77)<P>

If you don't have a Fortran 77 compiler, then you
can use "fink" to install a free one. Type:

<PRE>
    fink install g77
</PRE>

This takes awhile, so grab some lunch or see a movie.<P>

<LI>X11 server<P>

An X11 server will enable you to display NCL graphical
output to your screen. We recommend that you install Apple's X11
server, which you can obtain from:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/">http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

If you end up installing "xfree86" instead of Apple's X11 server, then
be sure to run:

<PRE>
    fink install system-xfree86
</PRE>

so fink will know about it.<P>

</OL>

NCL will build on a MacOSX system using the GNU or Absoft ProFortran
compilers.  It will <B>not</B> build using the Absoft XLF compilers,
because there's a problem with the way it handles the initialization
of common block routines. The problem was reported in July 2004; as of
December 2004, we hadn't heard of a fix. (If this problem has been
fixed and this information is out-of-date, please email <a
href="mailto:haley@ucar.edu">Mary Haley</a> and let her know.)<P>


<A NAME="StartBuildAndInstall"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Start the build and install process</H2>


Once you've run "Configure", and "make Info" gives you the correct
information, you can initiate the build and install process by
typing:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
cd $NCARG <BR>
make  Everything  >&  make-output  &
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Be patient; this can take from thirty minutes to a few hours depending
on your machine and its current load. During the installation, you may
examine the contents of the make-output file with the command:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
tail  -f  make-output
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

If you encounter errors during the build process, you can restart
without losing any of the work already accomplished. Refer to the
section "<A HREF="#RestartingInstallation">Restarting the
installation</A>" for details about recovering from errors that occur
during installation.
<P>
 
<A NAME="SetUpEnvironment"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Set up your environment to use NCL</H2>

Once the build process is complete, you need to do the following
before you can start using NCL:

<OL>
<LI>Set the environment variable NCARG_ROOT to the parent directory of
where you installed everything.

<LI>Make sure "$NCARG_ROOT/bin" is on your search path.

<LI>Make sure "$NCARG_ROOT/man" is on your man path.

</OL>

Here's an example (using csh) that assumes you installed
everything to the parent directory /usr/local:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
setenv &nbsp; NCARG_ROOT &nbsp; /usr/local<BR>
setenv &nbsp; PATH    &nbsp; $NCARG_ROOT/bin:$PATH<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</OL>
<P>

<A NAME="TestInstallation"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Test the NCL and/or NCAR Graphics installation</H2>

You can quickly test if NCL is installed properly by typing "ncl" with
the "-V" option to get the version, and then running a quick program:

<pre>
    ncl -V
    ng4ex gsun01n
</pre>

The <b>ng4ex</b> command will copy an NCL script called
<b>gsun01n.ncl</b> into your current working directory, and run it
with NCL. An X11 window should pop up with an XY plot drawn on it.
Click on this plot with your left mouse button to keep advancing to
the next frame.
<p>

Once this file is in your directory, you can also run it yourself
with:

<pre>
    ncl gsun01n.ncl
</pre>

If "ncl" seems to be working, then this indicates that your build
of NCAR Graphics was at least mostly successful, since NCL depends
on the NCAR Graphcis libraries.
<p>

To test NCAR Graphics only, there's an extensive suite of examples
available. You should refer to the <I><A
HREF="http://www.ncarg.ucar.edu/fund/fundhome.html">NCAR Graphics
Fundamentals</A></I>. It will show you how to run examples and test
programs, and how to view the resulting graphics. Using the
<B>ncargex</B> and <B>ctrans</B> programs is the easiest way to test
the installation and become familiar with the use of NCAR Graphics.<P>

For a quick test, try the following:

<pre>
    ncargex cpex08
    ctrans -d X11 cpex08.ncgm
</pre>

The first command will copy a file called <B>cpex08.f</B> into your
current working directory, compile, link, and execute it, and create a
graphics file called <B>cpex08.ncgm</B>.  The second command will
display the graphic on an X11 window on your screen. You must have
your DISPLAY environment variable set correctly for this command to
work.  Right-click on the X11 window to make the graphic go away.<P>
<P>

<A NAME="AppendixA"></A>
<H1>Appendix A - Modify configuration files to recognize your system</H1>
<HR>

You only need to read this section if $NCARG/ymake did not recognize
your system. (We'll refer to this as an <I>unsupported system</I>.) If
the Configure script recognized your system, then skip to the section
"<A HREF="#ModifySystemConfigFile">Modify system configuration file to
change default values</A>".<P>

The three steps you'll need to follow before building NCL on
an unsupported system are:

<OL>

<LI><A HREF="#ModifyYmakeFile">Modify the "ymake" file to recognize your system</A>.

<LI><A HREF="#SetUpConfigFile">Set up a configuration file</A>.

<LI><A HREF="#ModifyMachineDependentRoutines">Modify machine-dependent
routines</A> (if necessary).

</OL>

Once you've completed these three steps, then you need to run the
Configure script again as described in the "<A
HREF="#RunConfigure">Run Configure script</A>" section.<P>

<A NAME="ModifyYmakeFile"></A>
<B>1. Modify the "ymake" file to recognize your system</B><P>

For the first step, modify the file $NCARG/config/ymake and go
to the lines that read:<P>

<PRE>
    #   Figure out what kind of system we are on. We need to know the OS
    #   and the machine architecture.
</PRE>

Notice that the UNIX command "uname" is used to determine the
architecture type and operating system name. Once you figure out what
the various options that uname reports on your system, add your
machine architecture and operating system names to the case statements
that follow in the same manner as the other systems are done. You also
need to come up with a name for your configuration file. This is the
value you'll give to the "sysincs" variable. <A
HREF="#ExampleConfigFile">An example</A> will be provided below after
step 2.<P>

<A NAME="SetUpConfigFile"></A>
<B>2. Set up a configuration file</B><P>

For the second step, cd to $NCARG/config and prepare a configuration
file for your system that has the same name you used for the "sysincs"
variable in the ymake file. Use one of the existing configuration
files as a foundation (for example, "Sun4Solaris").  You will notice
several macros being defined in the configuration file. You only need
to define a macro if you want it to be something different than what
is defined in the "Template" file. The Template file is where all the
default values are set. For example, the default Fortran compiler is
set to "f77" in the Template file. If your Fortran compiler is called
"g77", then you would add the following line to your configuration
file:<P>

<PRE>
    #define    FCompiler       g77
</PRE>

To see what other macros are available and what the default values are
set to, see the Template file.  In particular, you may need to change
the following macros:<P>

<PRE>
    CCompiler
    FCompiler
    ExtraSysLibraries
    CcOptions
    FcOptions
    NgCallF
</PRE>
<P>

<A NAME="ExampleConfigFile"></A>
<B>Example on how to modify ymake file and set up configuration file</B><P>

As an example for the first two steps, suppose you are trying to build
a configuration file for a Koblinsky Systems Inc. SlothStation running
ChaOS version 5.4. Assume that the command "uname -s" returns "ChaOS"
and that "uname -m" returns "Sloth999". Modify the file
$NCARG/config/ymake and add:<P>

<PRE>
    case  ChaOS:
</PRE>

right after the first occurrence of the statement:<P>

<PRE>
    switch ("$foo")
</PRE>

You should now see something like:<P>

<PRE>
    switch ("$foo")
    case  ChaOS:
    case  SunOS:
    case  AIX:
    ...
</PRE>

Then, after the first occurrence of the statement:<P>

<PRE>
    switch("$opsys")
</PRE>

add the lines:<P>

<PRE>
    case  ChaOS:
        set  os      = $opsys
        set  arch    = $mach
        set  sysincs = Sloth
        set  vendor  = Koblinsky
    breaksw
</PRE>

and after the second occurrence add:<P>

<PRE>
    case  ChaOS:
</PRE>

where appropriate to get the correct major and minor operating system
version numbers defined.<P>

Let's further assume that this system is similar to a Sun workstation
running Solaris, so use the Sun4Solaris configuration file as a
foundation:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
cd  $NCARG/config<BR>
cp  Sun4Solaris  Sloth
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The file name "Sloth" is used because this is the value we gave
to the "sysincs" variable above. Make any obvious changes to the file
"Sloth". As mentioned above, you may need to change the following
macros:<P>

<PRE>
    CCompiler
    FCompiler
    ExtraSysLibraries
    CcOptions
    FcOptions
    NgCallF
</PRE>

Of particular note is the "NgCallF" macro. First, a little background:
the NCL code is predominantly Fortran code, but the Fortran
code relies on a number of C support routines. Since not all systems
support the same calling conventions (for example, some systems
require an underscore after a Fortran routine name, while others
require the name to be in uppercase), the installation system is
programmed to apply the macro "NgCallF" to all Fortran-called C
code.
<p>

The default value of this macro handles the case where an underscore
is appended after the Fortran routine name, so you won't need to
define this macro if this is the behavior of your compiler. If, however,
your compiler does not append an underscore (the IBM xlf/xlf90 compilers
are two such examples), then you need to set this macro as follows:

<PRE>
    NgCallF  reg
</PRE>

If your compiler converts the Fortran routine name to uppercase (this
is the case with old Cray and the Absoft ProFortran compilers),
then you need to set the macro to: 

<PRE>
    NgCallF  caps
</PRE>
<P>

<A NAME="ModifyMachineDependentRoutines"></A>
<B>3. Modify machine-dependent routines</B><P>

There are some machine dependent routines that you may need to modify
to indicate things like the standard input/output units, the number of
bits per integer, the smallest positive magnitude, and so on. All of
these machine-dependent requirements have been isolated in several
subroutines and it may be necessary to modify these subroutines before
building the software.<P>

The routines in question are:<P>

<PRE>
    GBYTES  ISHIFT
    G01MIO  I1MACH
    IAND    R1MACH
    IOR     SBYTES
</PRE>

These routines are referred to as "low-level support routines" in the
remainder of this section. Complete functional descriptions for these
routines appear in the section "<A
HREF="#MachineDependentRoutines">Machine-dependent support
routines</A>". Examples of implementations of all of these subroutines
except G01MIO are given in the directory:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
$NCARG/common/src/libncarg_c
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

A Fortran implementation of the support routine G01MIO is contained in
the directory:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/bwi
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

G01MIO is the basic I/O routine for NCAR's GKS package, and it is not
used anywhere else but in that package.<P>

The subroutines in the above two directories are examples only. These
examples may help you, and some may actually run on your machine, but
care must be taken to ensure that the implemented routines satisfy the
functional descriptions as given in the "<A
HREF="#MachineDependentRoutines">Machine-dependent support
routines</A>" section. Some of the examples given are coded in C.<P>

There is source code for creating an executable for testing
implementations of the low-level routines in the directory:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/bin/impltest
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The source in this directory may require changes only when
moving to a machine with a word size other than 32 or 64.<P>

This directory contains a program called "tlocal" that can be
used to test the implementations of IOR, IAND, ISHIFT, GBYTES, and
SBYTES. Read the prologue documentation in the code for tlocal
for implementation instructions. Success or failure messages will be
issued to Fortran unit 6. There are no tests for I1MACH and R1MACH,
but the success of the tlocal test depends on proper
implementation of I1MACH and R1MACH. Constants for I1MACH and R1MACH
for a large number of computers appear in the comment cards of I1MACH
and R1MACH. If constants for your host computer appear there, simply
uncomment the appropriate cards for your implementation of I1MACH and
R1MACH. Otherwise be very careful to implement I1MACH and R1MACH
correctly since there is no test for them. The support routine G01MIO
is used only by NCAR's GKS package, and no test for it is provided in
tlocal.<P>

Since many of the low-level support routines are executed frequently
throughout the package, efficient versions are desirable. There are
portable Fortran versions of GBYTES and SBYTES in the directory:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
$NCARG/common/src/libncarg_c
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

but they run very slowly. GBYTES and SBYTES are used primarily in the
NCGM translator; machine-language versions of these routines could
greatly speed up the translator. Machine-language versions of IAND,
IOR, and ISHIFT are also desirable.
<P>


<A NAME="AppendixB"></A>
<H1>Appendix B - General information on build process</H1>

This section contains general information on building NCL
that you may find useful.  It includes information on:

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="#ConfigurationFiles">configuration files</A>

<LI><A HREF="#RestartingInstallation">how to restart the
installation if it bombs</A>

<LI><A HREF="#ymake">the ymake system</A>

</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="ConfigurationFiles"></A>
<H3>Configuration files</H3>

Configuration files contain make macros. At installation time, these
macros are used by ymake to construct all of the Makefiles for
the NCL release.  Any change you make in your configuration
file will be distributed throughout the entire system. Refer to the
"<A HREF="#ymake">ymake</A>" section for more information.<P>

Configuration files reside in the directory $NCARG/config. They have
names like Sun4Solaris and SGI_IRIX to indicate the machine on which
they operate. For example, If you are on a Sun running Solaris, you
should make changes to the file $NCARG/config/SunSolaris. There is one
other file, "Rules", which contains make macros. Generally, you would
only change this file when you attempt to port the package to a new
system.<P>

A few of the macros are quite likely to change from system to system,
but most are not. The Configure script allows the installer to
make some of these minor changes to the configuration file without
editing it. You must be running csh in order to run
Configure.<P>

<A NAME="RestartingInstallation"></A>
<H3>Restarting the installation</H3>

The standard build process is initiated by telling make to build the
"Everything" target, which results in a series of actions. First, a
hierarchy of Makefiles is constructed, based on your system
configuration. Next, all old object code is removed, dependencies are
created, and then compilation, the most time-consuming step,
begins. Finally, libraries and executables are built and then
installed. This can take from thirty minutes to a few hours. If you
encounter an error along the way, it is very important that you avoid
wasting the work that has already been done. There are other targets
besides "Everything". The following targets may be used to gracefully
restart the installation process:<P>

<PRE>
    Everything = (Makefiles, clean, all, install)
    All        = (Makefiles, all, install)
    all        = (compile and build libraries)
    install    = (move objects to destinations)
    clean      = (remove object files, core dumps, etc.)
</PRE>

If a compilation fails halfway through the install process and you
have already created the Makefiles, cleaned out old object code, and
compiled a large number of files, you may first correct the problem and
then restart the install process.

To correct the problem, you need to first look carefully at the error
message in the make-output file.  By looking at the last several lines
of the make-output file, you should be able to determine which
directory the make stopped in.  For example, let's say see the
following in your make-output file:

<PRE>
...
Making ./ncarview/src/lib/libncarg_ras
cc -Xc  -O  -I../../../.././include -I/usr/openwin/include -I/usr/dt/include   -DBuildRasterHDF -DSUN -DBuildRasterHPPCL -DBuildRasterNrif -DBuildRasterSun  -DBuildRasterXWD  -DBuildRasterAVS -DBuildRasterSGI  -DBuildRasterAbekas  -DBuildRasterBinary -DBuildRasterYUV  -DNGTMPDIR='"tmp"' -Dsun4 -DSUN -DSYSV -D_XOPEN_SOURCE -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED=1 -D__EXTENSIONS__ -DNeedFuncProto   -c  raster.c

"hdf.c", line 192: cannot recover from previous errors
cc: acomp failed for hdf.c
*** Error code 2
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `hdf.o'
</PRE>

You can see from the:

<PRE>
    Making ./ncarview/src/lib/libncarg_ras
</PRE>

line that the make bombed in the directory
"ncarview/src/lib/libncarg_ras". The error message here indicates that
it can't find the HDF include files.  To fix this problem, then, you
would need to do one of three things:

<OL>

<LI>Install HDF on your system (see the section <A
HREF="#GetHDF">"Download the source code or binaries for HDF"</A>),
and then also follow step #2.

<LI>If HDF is already installed on your system, run "Configure" and
include the paths to HDF when it asks for local library and
include directory search paths.

<LI>Run "Configure" and answer <B>no</B> to the question: "Build HDF
support into raster library?".

</OL>

In most cases, the fix just involves modifying source files and
recompiling. If this is the case, then after you fix the source
file(s), you can restart the install process by typing:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
cd $NCARG<BR>
make all install >& make-output &
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In our example above with the HDF software, the fix involved something
that would affect the Makefiles.  In this case, then, you need to
regenerate the Makefiles. To do this, type:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
cd $NCARG<BR>
make All >& make-output &
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<A NAME="ymake"></A>
<H3>ymake</H3>

A utility named "ymake" is used by this package to generate the
Makefile hierarchy.<P>

A file named yMakefile exists in each directory and is
converted to a regular Makefile using the C preprocessor and a
collection of general and system-specific macros. The ymake
system resides in $NCARG/config. This allows the redundant
information in each Makefile to be isolated, in addition to
providing Makefile conditionals. The C preprocessor knows what
system it is running on. (The same technique is being employed in
other systems, including MIT's X Window System.)  If you need to
change a Makefile, implement the changes in the
yMakefile and then type:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
make me
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

If you completely destroy a Makefile, you can usually recover
by typing:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
$NCARG/config/ymkmf
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

There is more information about ymake in the ymake man
page which resides in the directory $NCARG/config.

<A NAME="MachineDependentRoutines"></A>
<H3>Machine-dependent support routines</H3>

Following are functional descriptions of the required
locally-implemented support routines. A test suite is distributed for
this package so that an implementor may verify that the
implementations are correct. The routine G01MIO is needed only if the
NCAR GKS package is being implemented.<P>

<B>FUNCTION ISHIFT(IWORD,N)<P></B><P>

IWORD is shifted by N bits. If N > 0, a left circular shift is
performed (all bits are shifted left N bits, and the bits that are
shifted out of the word to the left are shifted back into the word at
the right). If N < 0, a right end-off shift is performed (all bits are
shifted right by N bits, and the bits that are shifted out of the
right of the word are lost)-if the leftmost bit is 0, then the vacated
positions are filled with zeros; if the leftmost bit is 1, then the
vacated positions are undefined.  The implementor may assume that
IABS(N) .LE. word_length.<P>

<B>FUNCTION IAND(K1,K2)</B><P>

The bit-by-bit logical product of K1 and K2. If K3 = IAND(K1,K2), then
the nth bit of K3 is 0 if the nth bit of either K1 or K2 is 0;
otherwise the nth bit of K3 is 1.  FUNCTION IOR(K1,K2) The bit-by-bit
logical sum of K1 and K2. If K3 = IOR(K1,K2), then the nth bit of K3
is 0 if and only if the nth bit of both K1 and K2 is 0.<P>

<B>SUBROUTINE G01MIO(IOP,IUNIT,FNAME,IBUFF,LENGTH,IERROR)</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/bwi</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Input arguments</B><P>

<DL>

<DT>IOP
<DD>Indicates type of operation desired: IOP = 1 means OPEN workstation for 
output on IABS(IUNIT). IOP = 2 means CLOSE workstation for output on 
IABS(IUNIT). IOP = 3 means write IBUF to IABS(IUNIT). IOP = 4 means read 
IABS(IUNIT) into IBUF. IOP = 5 means position the record pointer to the 
beginning of the file. IOP = 6 means position the record pointer to the 
beginning of the previous record.

<DT>IUNIT
<DD>IABS(IUNIT) is the Fortran logical unit number on which IOP is to occur. 

<DT>FNAME
<DD>The filename to be used for the open operation. 

<DT>IBUFF
<DD>Buffer containing data for a read or write operation.

<DT>LENGTH
<DD>Length of data in IBUFF, in integer words.

</DL>

<B>Output arguments</B><P>

<DL>

<DT>IERROR
<DD>Error indicator that equals 0 if no errors.
</DL>

<B>SUBROUTINE GBYTES(NPACK,ISAM,IBIT,NBITS,NSKIP,ITER)</B><P>

This subroutine is used to unpack bit chunks from NPACK into the ISAM
array. A portable Fortran version of this routine is distributed, but
the Fortran version is inefficient and should be replaced with a more
efficient implementation.<P>

<DL>

<DT>NPACK
<DD>Address of first word of the array to be unpacked. For the
purposes of this subroutine, NPACK is viewed as a bit stream.

<DT>ISAM
<DD>Array to receive the unpacked bit chunks. They will be right
justified with zero-fill in this array. ISAM should be dimensioned for
ITER.

<DT>IBIT
<DD>A bit-count offset to be used before the first bit chunk is
unpacked. For example, if IBIT=3, and NBITS=5, then 3 bits in NPACK
will be skipped and the next 5 bits will be unpacked into ISAM(1).

<DT>NBITS

<DD>The number of bits in each bit chunk to be unpacked. An error
condition occurs if NBITS is larger than the number of bits-per-word
on the machine.

<DT>NSKIP
<DD>The number of bits to skip between each bit chunk to be
unpacked. Bits are skipped only after the first bit chunk has been
unpacked.

<DT>ITER
<DD>The number of bit chunks to be unpacked.
</DL>

For example:<P>

<PRE>
       CALL GBYTES(NPB,ISB,3,6,9,2)
</PRE>

In this call, three bits would be skipped at the beginning of NPB; the
next six bits would be unpacked into ISB(1) and right-justified with
zero-fill; nine bits would be skipped in NPB, and then the next six
bits of NPB would be unpacked into ISB(2) and right-justified with
zero-fill.<P>

<B>SUBROUTINE SBYTES(NPACK,ISAM,IBIT,NBITS,NSKIP,ITER)</B><P>

This subroutine is the reverse of GBYTES as described above.
NPACK-Address of first word of array to be packed.  ISAM-Array to be
packed into NPACK. The rightmost NBITS bits of each word will be
packed. ISAM should be dimensioned for at least ITER.  IBIT-A
bit-count offset to be used before the first bits are packed into
NPACK.

For example, if IBIT=3, and NBITS=5, 3 bits in NPACK will be skipped
before the rightmost 5 bits of ISAM(1) are packed into it.  NBITS-The
number of bits in each word of ISAM to be unpacked. An error condition
occurs if NBITS exceeds the word size on the machine.  NSKIP-The
number of bits to skip between each bit chunk packed.  ITER-The number
of bit chunks to be packed.<P>

For example:<P>

<PRE>
       CALL SBYTES(NPC,ISB,45,6,3,2)
</PRE>

In this call, 45 bits would be skipped at the beginning of NPC; the
rightmost 6 bits of ISB(1) would be packed into NPC; 3 bits would be
skipped in NPC, and the rightmost 6 bits of ISB(2) would be packed
into NPC.<P>
