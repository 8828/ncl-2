c this subroutine determines the coefficients c1, c2, and c3
c used to determine endpoint slopes. specifically, if
c function values y1, y2, and y3 are given at points x1, x2,
c and x3, respectively, the quantity c1*y1 + c2*y2 + c3*y3
c is the value of the derivative at x1 of a spline under
c tension (with tension factor sigma) passing through the
c three points and having third derivative equal to zero at
c x1. optionally, only two values, c1 and c2 are determined.
c
c on input--
c
c   del1 is x2-x1 (.gt. 0.).
c
c   del2 is x3-x1 (.gt. 0.). if n .eq. 2, this parameter is
c   ignored.
c
c   sigma is the tension factor.
c
c and
c
c   n is a switch indicating the number of coefficients to
c   be returned. if n .eq. 2 only two coefficients are
c   returned. otherwise all three are returned.
c
c on output--
c
c   c1, c2, and c3 contain the coefficients.
c
c none of the input parameters are altered.
c
c this subroutine references package module snhcsh.
