c this subroutine computes the diagonal and superdiagonal
c terms of the tridiagonal linear system associated with
c spline under tension interpolation.
c
c on input--
c
c   sigma contains the tension factor.
c
c and
c
c   del contains the step size.
c
c on output--
c
c                sigma*del*cosh(sigma*del) - sinh(sigma*del)
c   diag = del*--------------------------------------------.
c                     (sigma*del)**2 * sinh(sigma*del)

c
c and
