C   This subroutine adds an interior node to a triangulation
C of a set of points on the unit sphere.  The data structure
C is updated with the insertion of node KK into the triangle
C whose vertices are I1, I2, and I3.  No optimization of the
C triangulation is performed.
C
C   This routine is identical to the similarly named routine
C in TRIPACK.
C
C
C On input:
C
C       KK = Index of the node to be inserted.  KK .GE. 1
C            and KK must not be equal to I1, I2, or I3.
C
C       I1,I2,I3 = Indexes of the counterclockwise-ordered
C                  sequence of vertices of a triangle which
C                  contains node KK.
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this routine.
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LEND,LNEW = Data structure defining the
C                             triangulation.  Refer to Sub-
C                             routine CSTRMESH.  Triangle
C                             (I1,I2,I3) must be included
C                             in the triangulation.
C
C On output:
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LEND,LNEW = Data structure updated with
C                             the addition of node KK.  KK
C                             will be connected to nodes I1,
C                             I2, and I3.
