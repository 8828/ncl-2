C   This subroutine inserts K as a neighbor of N1 following
C N2, where LP is the LIST pointer of N2 as a neighbor of
C N1.  Note that, if N2 is the last neighbor of N1, K will
C become the first neighbor (even if N1 is a boundary node).
C
C   This routine is identical to the similarly named routine
C in TRIPACK.
C
C
C On input:
C
C       K = Index of the node to be inserted.
C
C       LP = LIST pointer of N2 as a neighbor of N1.
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this routine.

C       LIST,LPTR,LNEW = Data structure defining the trian-
C                        gulation.  Refer to Subroutine
C                        CSTRMESH.
C
C On output:
C
C       LIST,LPTR,LNEW = Data structure updated with the
C                        addition of node K.
