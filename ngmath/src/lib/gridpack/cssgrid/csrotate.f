C
C   This routine is identical to Subroutine SROT from the
C LINPACK BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines).
C
C On input:
C
C       N = Number of columns to be rotated.
C
C       C,S = Elements of the Givens rotation.  Refer to
C             Subroutine CSGIVENS.
C
C The above parameters are not altered by this routine.
C
C       X,Y = Arrays of length .GE. N containing the compo-
C             nents of the vectors to be rotated.
C
C On output:
C
C       X,Y = Arrays containing the rotated vectors (not
C             altered if N < 1).
C
C Modules required by CSROTATE:  None
