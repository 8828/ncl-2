To get the latest versions of the I1MACH and R1MACH routines:
------------------------------------------------------------
Send email to netlib@ornl.gov with the following request in the
subject header or text body:

  send i1mach from slatec/src

You'll promptly (depending on Internet traffic) receive e-mail from
netlib, containing the I1MACH source code.  Of course, you can do this
for D1MACH as well.
