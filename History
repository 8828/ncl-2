03/08/91 - Created as a copy of the official "3.01".  Included a round of
	   mods from Fred for GFLASH, AWI, and BWI.  Changed the name of
	   the routine "DRLINE" to "CRDRLN" (in CONREC, in CONRECSUPER, and
	   in FINDG).
	   Test-installed.
03/14/91 - Updated "ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/awi" to include Fred's latest
	   mod for the problem with calls to FRAME to create blank frames.
03/19/91 - Changed "ncarg2d/src/bin/cgmtrans" to use names of the form
	   "lj_*.f" in place of "lj.*.f", which was causing problems on
	   Sparc Stations running 4.1.
03/19/91 - Changed "ncarview.src.lib.libctrans.gcap.c" to fix a problem of
	   long standing when using different line types.
03/20/91 - Implemented a new command to update copyrights and version numbers
	   and used it to change everything to "3.02".
03/20/91 - Updated SPPS to fix a problem with WTSTR generating bad calls to
	   GSTXAL.
03/21/91 - Changed "ncarg2d/src/bin/cgmtrans/yMakefile" to have spaces
	   preceding the backslashes in the macro definitions.
03/25/91 - Changed "ncarg2d/src/bin/yMakefile" and "ncarg2d/src/bin/ncargsrcx/
	   yMakefile" so that "ncargsrcx" will be made on a machine on which
	   it is supposed to be made, even if it was not made on the machine
	   on which the distribution files came from.
04/05/91 - Fixed bugs in CONPACK.  Corrected the algorithm used to set a flag
	   which says whether the transformations in effect cause mirror
	   imaging (which changes the definition of "left" and "right" for
	   edges going into an area map) and corrected three calls to AREDAM
	   in which code in that routine to compensate for mirror-imaging was
	   improperly accounted for. Corrected code which inserts the edge of
	   the grid in an area map in such a way as to use the correct area
	   identifier for the inside of the grid in some areas near special
	   values where it previously did not use the correct value.
04/05/91 - Updated all the graphcaps from the generic source.  Added a
	   "SOFTWARE_SIMULATION_SPACING" to the "versaterm" graphcap.
04/05/91 - Did a "make Makefiles" to update the copyrights in the Makefiles.
04/05/91 - Added to "AREAS" the capability of finding out, from inside the
	   user routine "APR" (which is called by "ARSCAM" once for each
	   area defined by the area map), whether the boundary of the area
	   was traced in a clockwise or a counter-clockwise order.
04/10/91 - Deleted some unused files from "ncarg2d/src/bin/scripts":
	   ftrans.csh, cgmtrans.csh, and some "yacc" files that were created
	   accidentally due to the temporary existence of a ".y" file.
04/11/91 - Changed "pre2ncgm" to take out the full path name for the ".prog"
	   file that it executes, which was the only occurrence of a need to
	   have "$(BINDIR)" available.
04/17/91 - Changed CONPACK to fix cases in which, despite the user's forcing
	   the use of specific contour levels, the presence of huge values in
	   the data field was causing numeric labels to be incorrect.
04/18/91 - Changed "ncargcc" and "ncargcc.csh" to refer to "Cray" instead of
	   "CrayXMP".
04/18/91 - Fixed the 04/17/91 fix of CONPACK, which had been found wanting.
	   Also bumped the size of the character buffers for contour-line
	   labels from 20 to 40 and changed CPNUMB to avoid returning a value
	   for NBUF exceeding the length of the buffer.
04/19/91 - Fixed "/lib/cpp/more" (in the release notes) to read "/lib/cpp |
	   more".
04/23/91 - Fixed an error in "awi", described by Fred thusly:  "Fixed one more
	   bug in the apparently infinite set introduced by the picture-naming
	   logic.  This bug was causing an unknown error to be issued from
	   GPL.  Removed the GECLKS call when too many error messages are
	   issued which could result in an infinite loop."
04/23/91 - Fixed an error in AREAS which caused problems when edges were
	   added to a previously preprocessed area map.
04/25/91 - Added the routine MAPTRA to EZMAP.
04/25/91 - Changed the CONPACK routine CPMPXY to call MAPTRA instead of
	   MAPTRN.  This makes it possible to properly clip CONPACK output
	   on an EZMAP background at the perimeter defined by EZMAP.
04/27/91 - Changed MAPBLA, in EZMAPA, to generate ellipses (for perimeters and
	   limbs) more accurately (on machines with small word lengths, these
	   were sometimes not closed) and to get rid of a kludge which was
	   intended to get around a problem with AREAS when the perimeter and
	   the limb fall exactly on top of one another.
04/27/91 - Changed ARPRAM, in AREAS, to reconcile conflicting information (as
	   when the perimeter and the limb generated by MAPBLA fall exactly
	   on top of one another) in a more useful way.
05/05/91 - Changed the default value of the parameter which says what area
	   identifier CPCLAM, in CONPACK, is to use for the outside of the
	   grid - from "-1" to "0".  This prevents problems which arise when
	   the mapping function carries more than one side of the grid into
	   the same line in the area map (as, for example, when the grid is
	   mapped onto the globe).  Also changed CPCLAM to add the viewport
	   to the area map unconditionally, rather than just when mapping is
	   turned on.  This will ensure that, in simple cases, the area
	   outside the viewport will have area identifier "-1", as has been
	   the case in the past.
05/05/91 - Changed ARPRAM, in AREAS, again, to handle conflicting information
	   in a still more useful way (made necessary by the above change
	   in CONPACK).  In the case where different area identifiers are
	   given for the same side of the same line, but one of them is zero
	   and the other is greater than zero, the latter value is used.
05/05/91 - Changed CONPACK example 4.  Because of the change in CONPACK, the
	   area map array was no longer big enough.
05/08/91 - Updated EZMAP to make MAPIT interpolate points along the great
	   circle between pairs of points in the areas of greatest distortion
	   on stereographic, Lambert equal-area, gnomonic, and azimuthal
	   equal-area projections.  This involved adding a new routine,
	   MAPGCI, which for the moment will be left as an internal routine,
	   but which may eventually be of interest to users.
05/08/91 - Updated EZMAPA to make MAPITA and MAPITM interpolate points in the
	   same way that MAPIT (see above) now does.  This fixes problems that
	   arose when color-filling maps using the projections mentioned
	   above.  The routine MAPBLA was also changed:  it no longer puts
	   both the perimeter and the limb in the area map if the perimeter
	   and the limb are identical; this fixes yet another problem with
	   solid-filled maps.
05/09/91 - Changed the directory $NCARG/common/src/libncarg_loc so that, on
	   DECRISC systems, the dummy routine "s_abort" will be added to
	   "libncarg_loc.a".
05/10/91 - Changed $NCARG/ncarg2d/src/bin/scripts/yMakefile to generate a
	   different "ncargcc" and "ncargf77" on Crays.  This also required
	   creating new source files, called "ncargcc.cry" and "ncargf77.cry".
	   This also corrects a problem with using "ncargcc" on certain
	   machines.
05/14/91 - Changed the value of the "FLOAT_OPT" macro in the distributed Sun3
	   configuration file to a null instead of "-fswitch".  This is what
	   I have been using in my test installs on "redcloud"; I don't know
	   why it was left in the distributed configuration file.
05/22/91 - Replaced ISOSRF with a whole new version.  Bugs fixed, internal
	   parameters defined, parameter access mechanisms installed.
05/22/91 - Copied John's latest version of "ncarview" from the directory
	   "/u1/clyne/ncarg3.02/ncarview".  Changed the version number to
	   "3.1.1".
05/22/91 - Made a "tar" file in "~ncargftp/pub" for 3.1.1 on "shavano".
05/23/91 - Changed the name of the directory from "ncarg3.02" to "ncarg3.1.1".
05/23/91 - Changed the target "Info" in the main "yMakefile" to "cat" the
	   file "Version" to the output, so that "make" output files will
	   automatically contain version and copyright information.
05/23/91 - Changed the yMakefile in "$NCARG/common/src/fontc" to include
	   the ".F.o" rule on Crays.  (Something has changed on "shavano"
	   and the implicit rule no longer works.)
05/23/91 - Ditto for the yMakefiles in "$NCARG/common/src/graphc", "$NCARG/
	   common/src/libncarg_loc", "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg/plotchar",
	   and "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/awi".
05/23/91 - Changed "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/liboptional/ncarbd/ncarbd.f" to refer
	   to the ISOSRF BLOCK DATA routine by its new name.
05/24/91 - Corrected the spelling of the Latin phrase in EZMAP example 4 per
	   comments from Fabio Cavallini, of the Osservatorio Geofisico
	   Sperimentale, in Trieste.
05/24/91 - Removed the "-h olevel_0" from the definition of "COPT" in the
	   configuration file for the Cray.  John says this should not be
	   necessary and, in fact, is a bad idea.
05/24/91 - Updated the "tar" file in "~ncargftp/pub" for 3.1.1 on "shavano".
05/24/91 - Inserted four silly statements in the AUTOGRAPH routine AGEXAX to
	   prevent problems with the compiler on UNICOS 6.0.
05/24/91 - Returned the "-h olevel_0" to the definition of "COPT" in the
	   configuration file for the Cray.  Taking it out caused lots of
	   problems.
05/24/91 - Updated the "tar" file in "~ncargftp/pub" for 3.1.1 on "shavano".
05/25/91 - Created "ncarg3.1.2" as a copy of "ncarg3.1.1".
05/28/91 - Corrected "ncarview/src/lib/libctrans/X_pixdump.c" per John's
	   instructions to make it install on "uncompahgre".
05/28/91 - Added the macro "TMPDIR" to all the configuration files and made
	   it possible to change it using "Configure".
05/29/91 - Changed the macro "BuildX11ctrans" to "BuildXlibDependentCode" in
	   all the configuration files in which it appeared.
05/29/91 - I just received two lists from John Clyne, describing the latest
	   changes in the "ncarview" that I copied in on 05/22/91.  Bug fixes
	   were as follows:

	   + "Hollow" filled polygons and dashed lines are now handled for
	     graphcap devices by translators
	   + Ctrans now works correctly when not connected to a tty.
	   + Ctrans now correctly parses the read-from-stdin option, '-'
	   + Text that has a shearing transformation applied to it is now
	     displayed correctly by the translators.
	   + Med no longer core dumps when working with large metafiles.
	   + Idt now handles saving of multiple frames to a single metafile
	     correctly.

	   New functionality is as follows:

	   + Ctrans now has direct rasterization support for sunraster, xwd,
	     hdf, and nrif rasterfiles.

	   + Translators now accept options for setting a default foreground
	     and background drawing color.

	   + Translators now have an option for specifying a default color
	     palette which overrides the palette supplied by the metafile
	     being translated.

	   + The default size of idt's message display panel is now a settable
	     resource.

	   + The number of button clicks necessary to display a metafile with
	     idt has been reduced.

	   + There is now a "set window" button in idt which lets you stay
	     "zoomed" for multiple frames.

	   + There is now a "set window" button in idt which lets you stay
	     "zoomed" for multiple frames.

05/30/91 - Copied in John's fixes for a couple of small bugs in "ncarview".
	   Added "-bnodelcsect" to the "LD_CFLAGS" macro in the configuration
	   file for the RS6000.
05/30/91 - Defined "BuildXlibDependentCode" in the configuration file for the
	   Sun4, in which it had somehow been omitted.
05/30/91 - Changed "Configure" to look in the configuration file for the new
	   macro "BuildXlibDependentCode" instead of "BuildX11ctrans".
05/30/91 - Changed ".../ncarview/src/lib/libctrans/default.c", ".../ncarview/
	   src/lib/libctrans/cterror.c", and the contents of the directory
	   ".../ncarview/bin/RS6000" to match John's.  The first two changes
	   get rid of code turning off clipping for debug purposes and the
	   third introduces up-to-date binaries for the RS6000.
05/31/01 - Shortened the name of a new variable in "Configure".
05/31/91 - Corrected "ncarview/src/lib/libctrans/X_pixdump.c" again.  John
	   had somehow copied in the old one, so install wouldn't work on
	   various machines.
05/31/91 - Removed a ".old" file from "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg/plotchar".
06/03/91 - Changed the uppermost "yMakefile" to echo a line indicating what
	   sort of "make" is being done.
06/04/91 - Copied in a new "ncarview/src/bin/yMakefile" and a new "ncarview/
	   src/bin/rasview/yMakefile" which support distribution of a binary
	   version of "rasview".  Also copied in a complete set of binaries
	   for "rasview" (to "ncarview/bin/DECRISC", "ncarview/bin/Sun3",
	   etc.)
06/04/91 - Changed CPCLAM, in CONPACK, to put an area identifier of zero on
	   the inside of the viewport.  In cases where the viewport was
	   bigger than the grid, using a non-zero value was causing the area
	   inside the viewport, but outside the grid, to have the wrong area
	   identifier.  (The change that I made on 05/05/91 [changing the
	   default area identifier for the outside of the grid from "-1" to
	   "0"] uncovered this problem.)
06/06/91 - Changed the Sun3 configuration file to use "-fswitch" for the
	   FLOAT_OPT macro.  This should not have been taken out on 5/14.
06/10/91 - Copied new "troff" files for "3.1.1" into "$NCARG/doc.
06/11/91 - Corrected questionable grammar in the "Copyright" notices.
-----------3.1.2 BEGINS HERE--------------------------------------------------
06/14/91 - Changed copyright notices to have all required dates, instead
	   of just the latest one.
06/14/91 - Added the command "ncargtar", which will "tar" up the installed
	   directories for backup purposes.
06/15/91 - Did "make Update"s or the equivalent for all directories affected
	   by Fred's removal of copyrights from the generic sources.
06/16/91 - Test-installed on "redcloud".  Found that I had introduced a bug
	   in the program that converts the EZMAP database and fixed it.
06/17/91 - Changed all the copyright notices to include the date "1989".
06/21/91 - Changed the "yMakefile" in "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/bin/psfltrs" to
	   make the "all" target a dummy, so that compilations don't happen
	   until the "install" phase, when "libncarg_loc" has been made.
06/24/91 - Changed "ncargtar" to make "tar" files for "XAPPDIR" and "BITSDIR".
06/24/91 - Threw out the first version of "ncargtar" in favor of one that
	   makes a single "tar" file with everything on it.
06/24/91 - The second version of "ncargtar" wouldn't work on "shavano", so I
	   tried a third version, which effectively runs forever because of
	   "quadratic behavior".
06/24/91 - Put in a fourth version of "ncargtar"; this one seems to get around
	   all the problems.  It's still slow on "shavano", but it works, and
	   it doesn't flail.
06/25/91 - Added a "man" page for "ncargtar" and added "ncargtar.l" to the
	   list of things that "ncargtar" copies into the "tar" file from
	   the directory "$mandir".
06/26/91 - Updated PWRITXNT to change all occurrences of "8625" to "8626".
	   This makes a couple of arrays one word bigger, so that an error
	   which causes a store one word past the end of one of the arrays
	   is rendered benign.  This is not the most elegant solution to
	   the problem, but it is effective and does not require changing
	   anything but PWRITXNT.
07/02/91 - Updated AWI per Fred's instructions to "add a flag to GCLWK to
	   indicate empty picture".
07/02/91 - Updated the CONPACK routine CPPKLB to generate meaningful labels
	   in the case when the only level for which a label is not specified
	   is level 0.
07/04/91 - Updated CONPACK to force the use of a positive contour interval
	   supplied by the user, even if using that interval means that no
	   contours will result.  Much code had to be reviewed to make sure
	   that it would work with a zero value of NCLV, and a few small
	   changes resulted from this.
07/09/91 - Turned off optimization of GRIDAL on DECRISC systems.
07/09/91 - Installed macros "PARFIL_INIT" and "PARFIL_PERM" in all the
	   configuration files.  The first says where to install the new
	   NCAR Graphics parameter file initially and the second says what
	   its intended permanent location is.
07/10/91 - Changed the files "$NCARG/common/src/graphc/capast.F","$NCARG/
	   ncarg2d/src/libncarg/plotchar/plchhq.F", and "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/
	   libncarg/plotchar/plchmq.F" to define a single apostrophe in a
	   way which will work on both the MIPS and RISC compilers on Ultrix
	   systems.
07/10/91 - Added a "-fpe3" to the definition of "FOPT" in the configuration
	   file for DECRISC machines.  This is necessary to make some of the
	   examples run correctly and, I suspect, more generally, since NCAR
	   Graphics utilities generally assume that underflow yields a zero
	   result.  This should be mentioned in the release notes for 3.1.2.
	   The new compiler is FORTRAN 3.0 and is Digital's own.  Earlier
	   compilers (1.xx and 2.xx) were written by MIPS, who also makes
	   the CPU chip for all DEC RISC machines.  (This change came out
	   later in the day and has been found to be completely unnecessary.)
07/10/91 - Removed the "-fpe3" from the definition of "FOPT" again.  I think
	   it is unnecessary.  At the very least, the situation is confused.
07/10/91 - Changed the contents of the directory "/u2/ncargfx/ncarg3.1.2/
	   common/src/libncarg_loc" to put the new routines "GETNGP" (to be
	   called from FORTRAN) and "gtngpa" (to be called from C) in the
	   binary library "libncarg_loc".  These routines allow one to pick
	   up the values of parameters from the NCAR Graphics parameter file.
07/11/91 - Added a $(FFLAGS) to the line that causes the AWI routine GZTOWK
	   to be compiled with optimization turned off (on the Cray).
07/12/91 - Changed the routine GENDAT, which is used in AUTOGRAPH example 9
	   and in all the CONPACK examples, to make sure the argument of EXP
	   doesn't go less than -20.  On DECRISC systems using FORTRAN 3.0,
	   this was causing over/underflow problems.
07/12/91 - Created a subdirectory "$NCARG/common/src/params", from which the
	   NCAR Graphics parameter file is to be created, and put in it the
	   appropriate files to cause this to happen.
07/12/91 - Modified the EZMAP routine OPENMP to get the full path name of the
	   EZMAP dataset from the NCAR Graphics parameter file.  Works!
07/12/91 - Modified the scripts "ncargf77", "ncargex", "ncargcc", "ncargsrcy",
	   and "ncargtar" to use the NCAR Graphics parameter file.  Similarly
	   modified the PWRITX routine OPENPW, the PLOTCHAR routine PCFOPN,
	   and the BNCHMK routine OPENR.
07/13/91 - Modified the pieces of "ncargsrc" so as to make it use the NCAR
	   Graphics parameter file.  To plug a security leak, I had to
	   essentially disable the use of "ncargsrc" when the environment
	   variable NCARG_PARAMETER_FILE is set.  This is not terribly
	   important, since "ncargsrc" is only supported on systems at NCAR
	   and we will only be using NCARG_PARAMETER_FILE during preliminary
	   testing.
07/13/91 - Increased the size limit for a value in the parameter file from
	   80 characters to 128 characters.
07/13/91 - Got rid of the header file "env.h" and modified "env.c" to use
	   the new parameter file access mechanisms.  Re-installed "cgmtrans"
	   to test the new stuff; it seems to work.
07/13/91 - Modified all occurrences of "get_fcapname" and "get_gcapname" to
	   read "getFcapname" and "getGcapname", instead.  This was done for
	   consistency with "ncarview".  Also changed a couple of references
	   to "get_libpath()" (which no longer exists) to "gtngpa("LIBDIR").
07/13/91 - Modified the way in which the scripts "ctlib", "fcaps", and "gcaps"
	   are generated by "ncarview"; they now get required information from
	   the NCAR Graphics parameter file.
07/13/91 - In the directory "$NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libctrans", modified the
	   "yMakefile" and the file "env.c" to use the NCAR Graphics parameter
	   file.  The file "env.h" went away.
07/13/91 - In the directory "$NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libictrans", modified the
	   "yMakefile" and the files "spooler.c" and "commands.c" to use the
	   NCAR Graphics parameter file.
07/13/91 - Reinstalled "ctrans" and "ictrans".  They work.
07/16/91 - Finished updating the "Configure" script to include the updating
	   of the parameter file names.  I also changed the indenting so as
	   to be able to figure out which "if" a given "endif" goes with and
	   I changed some of the wording to be more self-consistent.
07/17/91 - Changed the routine "gtngpa" to recognize the parameter name
	   "PARFIL", rather than "PARFIL_INIT" and "PARFIL_PERM", which did
	   not have a precisely defined meaning.
07/17/91 - Updated "ncargtar" to use the new parameter-file scheme.
07/17/91 - Changed "Configure" to say that "ncargmv" has no arguments, which
	   will be the case.  It will move the parameter file pointed to by
	   the current "gtngpa" (as called by "ncargpar"), by default or as
	   overridden by the environment variable NCARG_PARAMETER_FILE.
07/17/91 - Wrote the new command "ncargmv" and checked it out pretty well.
07/17/91 - Wrote somewhat sketchy "man" pages for "ncargpar" and "ncargmv".
07/18/91 - Doing test installation on "redcloud".  Had to fix the CGMTRANS
	   file "mfio.c", which still referenced the routines "getFcapname"
	   and "getGcapname" by the names "get_fcapname" and "get_gcapname".
	   Ditto for the PLOTCHAR file "bofred.c".
07/19/91 - Swapped in a new "Configure", with some changes from John Clyne
	   to correct the setting of "altered".
07/19/91 - Added a "-lsc" to the definitions of "LD_CFLAGS" and "LD_FFLAGS"
	   in the configuration file for the Cray.  This is needed when one
	   uses "scc" and will have to be taken out when we go to UNICOS 6.1.
	   For some reason, we have not had trouble with this is the past;
	   the addition of the routine GETNGP triggered the problem.
07/21/91 - In "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/bin/bnchmk", deleted "rand.f" (which has
	   been replaced by "randno.f") and added the array "A" to the list
	   of things SAVEd in RANDNO.  This makes "bnchmk" work again on
	   the Cray.
07/22/91 - Updated several of the scripts that now reference "ncargpar" to
	   do more robust error reporting than they were doing before.
07/25/91 - Updated the commenting in EZMAPA to reflect changes made in the
	   example for that utility.
07/25/91 - Updated all the utility tests to replace out-of-date WTSTR and
	   SETUSV calls.
07/25/91 - Updated the EZMAPA example to replace out-of-date SETUSV calls.
07/25/91 - In accordance with John's instructions regarding the status of
	   X11 bitmap dependencies, I have removed from "Configure", from
	   the commands "ncargmv" and "ncargtar", and from the NCAR Graphics
	   parameter file, all references to the bitmap directories.  When I
	   next swap in a new version of "ncarview", I will remove the macros
	   BITSDIR and INSTALL_BIT from all of the configuration files.
07/25/91 - Updated the "README" in "$NCARG" to remove references to files
	   which no longer exist.
07/26/91 - Removed copyrights from "$NCARG/config/ymake" (since the existence
	   of the file called "Copyright" has been deemed sufficient) and to
	   fix spelling errors.
07/26/91 - Changed "$NCARG/config/ymake-filter.c" and the "yMakefile"s in
	   "$NCARG/ncarview/app" and "$NCARG/ncarview/bits" to compensate
	   for changes in "cpp" under UNICOS 6.1.
07/27/91 - Changed "$NCARG/config/ymake-filter.c" again to look for "line"
	   directives, as described in the C standard, and remove them.
07/29/91 - Added a "-f" to the "/bin/csh" in each of the scripts "ctlib",
	   "pre2ncgm", and "imagen"; also moved the "/bin/csh" to be the
	   first line in "ctlib, rather than to follow some comment lines.
	   This prevents problems which arise from executing the ".cshrc"
	   when ctlib starts up.
07/29/91 - Moved the generation of "ncargpar" from "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/bin/
	   ncargpar" to "$NCARG/common/src/ncargpar", so that it will be
	   available to "ncarview" if "ncarview" is distributed separately.
07/30/91 - Fixed the script "ncargtar" to include the parameter file and
	   the "ncargsrc.stats" file and to deal with the database, fontcap,
	   graphcap, example, and test directories separately, so that it
	   is actually possible to put them in places other than in the
	   libraries directory.
07/30/91 - Fixed the script "ncargmv" to deal with the database, fontcap,
	   graphcap, example, and test directories separately.  Also fixed
	   several small glitches.
07/30/91 - Added a newline to the output from "ncargpar", so as to make it
	   more useful from the command line.  This doesn't seem to cause a
	   problem in scripts, which I had thought would be the case.
07/31/91 - Fixed a bug in "gtngpa.f" that was causing it to go into an
	   infinite loop on "shavano".
07/31/91 - Changed "Configure" to stress the fact that a parameter FILE name
	   is being requested.
07/31/91 - Re-organized the structure of "$NCARG/common" to be more nearly
	   parallel with that of "$NCARG/ncarg2d" and "$NCARG/ncarview" and
	   moved "ncargtar" and "ncargmv" to it, so that they will be
	   available with an "ncarview" distribution.
08/01/91 - Modified the configuration file for the Cray as needed to install
	   under UNICOS 6.1.
08/01/91 - Modified the "yMakefile"s in "$NCARG/common/src/libncarg_loc",
	   "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg/plotchar", and "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/
	   libncarg_gks/awi" to ensure that ".f" files for which there are
	   corresponding ".F" files will be removed, no matter what.
08/06/91 - Copied in John's new "ncarview".  (I first copied the old one
	   to "../ncarview3.1.2.old".)  Am about to make a new "tar" file
	   for "3.1.2" in "~ncargftp/pub" that I can test on "redcloud"
	   and on "shavano".
08/07/91 - Corrected the "yMakefile" in "$NCARG/ncarview/app" to get rid of
	   a colon that confuses "ymake-filter".
08/07/91 - Copied Cray binaries back into "$NCARG/ncarview/bin/Cray"; these
	   were made on "shavano" under "6.1".
08/07/91 - Removed "ncarv_spool" from the lists in "ncargmv" and "ncargtar".
08/07/91 - Made minor cosmetic change in the upper-level yMakefile.
08/08/91 - Updated the copyrights in "ncarview" to refer to "3.1.2".
08/09/91 - Copied in a new "$NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libctrans/ctrans.c",
	   with a one-card change from John.  Have not re-installed "ctrans".
08/09/91 - Copied in new "ncarview" binaries from John.  Discovered possible
	   problem with using binaries that we send out:  Users may have to
	   set "NCARG_PARAMETER_FILE" in order to use those binaries.  Must
	   consider what to do.
08/13/91 - Put "SAVE IOPEN" statements in the EZMAP routine OPENMP, the
	   PWRITX routine OPENPW, and the BNCHMK routine OPENR.
08/13/91 - Amended all FORTRAN routines with OPEN statements to include the
	   keyword "READONLY" on DECRISC systems.
08/14/91 - Changed the CONPACK routine CPTREV so that it doesn't exit on
	   "algorithm failure" in pathological cases.  In such cases, there
	   is a good chance that the plot will be okay anyway, so there is
	   no reason to quit.
08/15/91 - Copied in the files "/u1/clyne/ncarg3.1.2/ncarview/src/lib/
	   libncarg_ras/{yMakefile,devices.h}" which, according to John,
	   makes it possible to compile "ctrans" when no X include files
	   are present.
08/15/91 - Changed the EZMAP routine MAPTRA to use a perimeter slightly
	   inside the "actual" perimeter.
08/16/91 - Copied in the files "/u1/clyne/ncarg3.1.2/ncarview/src/bin/
	   scripts/{fcaps,gcaps.csh,ctlib.csh,version.sed}" to fix a
	   minor problem with the placement of the line "#!/bin/csh -f".
08/16/91 - Copied in the file "/u1/clyne/ncarg3.1.2/ncarview/src/lib/
	   libictrans/yMakefile" to add another file to the list of things
	   removed by "clean".
08/19/91 - Changed the unit number used by "tisohr" from "7" to "4" to
	   sidestep a problem on the HP.
08/19/91 - Copied in the files "/u1/clyne/ncarg3.1.2/ncarview/src/lib/
	   libncarg_ras/{hdf.c,yMakefile}" to fix a user-reported problem
	   with "ctrans".
08/21/91 - Changed the file "$NCARG/common/src/libncarg_loc/iargct.f" so
	   that IARGC is called with no arguments, rather than with a dummy
	   argument.  This gave an error on the new HP.
08/22/91 - Updated the AREAS routine ARPRAM to modify some of what I did
	   last May, which had proved to have unfortunate side effects.
08/22/91 - Copied in new "ncarview" man pages.
08/23/91 - Corrected "Configure", which was unconditionally deleting the
	   line "#define BuildUnsupportedAthenaApplications".
08/23/91 - Copied in a new "ncarview/src/lib/libncarg_ras/xwd.c", with a
	   correction for the HP.
08/23/91 - Ran a "make Makefiles" so that the "ncarview" Makefile would
	   define "app" to be a subdirectory (the mistake in "Configure"
	   caused it not to be so defined) and then made a new "tar" file.
08/25/91 - Added a debug flag ('DB') to AREAS.  When set non-zero, it causes
	   ARPRAM to produce a set of plots showing what is in the area map
	   at various times.
08/25/91 - I am about to make a new "tar" file.
08/26/91 - Copied in binaries made under UNICOS 6.1.4 into "$NCARG/ncarview/
	   bin/Cray".  Curiously, the version of "idt" included does not have
	   the problems that the one made under UNICOS 5.1.xx does.
08/26/91 - Copied new "yMakefile"s into "$NCARG/ncarview" and "$NCARG/
	   ncarview/app".  This change means that the "app" subdirectory is
	   always defined; if "BuildUnsupportedAthenaApplications" is not
	   defined, nothing gets installed from the subdirectory.
08/26/91 - Copied in John's corrected version of "$NCARG/config/Rules",
	   which avoids installing a "Copyright" file in the "bin" directory.
08/26/91 - Copied in Fred's new version of the CGMTRANS routine VDCEXT.
08/26/91 - Copied in the new files "$NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libictrans/
	   commands.c" and "$NCARG/ncarview/src/bin/idt/talkto.c", which
	   should fix the observed problems with "idt".
08/26/91 - Copied in another new copy of "$NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libictrans/
	   commands.c".
08/27/91 - Made new Sun3 binaries and copied in new DECRISC binaries made on
	   "conundrum".
08/27/91 - At John's suggestion, I updated the "$NCARG/common/src/params/
	   yMakefile" so that "make install" will work when the file "params"
	   does not currently exist.
08/27/91 - Copied in new Sun4, SGI4D, and RS6000 binaries.
08/27/91 - Copied in new directories "$NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libhdf/HPUX"
	   and "$NCARG/ncarview/bin/HPUX".
08/27/91 - I am about to remake the "tar" file for 3.1.2.
08/28/91 - Copied in new binaries made on "shavano" under UNICOS 6.1.4.
08/28/91 - Changed the EZMAPA routine MAPBLA to put the perimeter and the
	   limb line into the area map in a different way, which I hope will
	   get rid of problems with certain projections.
08/30/91 - Remaking the "tar" file for 3.1.2.
08/30/91 - Changed the EZMAPA routine MAPBLA again to trace the effective
	   limbs of the Lambert equal area and azimuthal equidistant
	   projections, rather than the hypothetical ones.  This should
	   help get rid of some problems.
08/30/91 - Copied in new "man" pages for "ictrans".
09/09/91 - Copied in new versions of "$NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libctrans/
	   X_pixdump.c" and "$NCARG/config/RS6000", from John, to get around
	   a problem which kept "ctrans" from compiling on the RS6000.
09/10/91 - Copied in a new version of "$NCARG/ncarview/src/bin/rasview/
	   rasview.c" to fix a problem which was preventing "rasview" from
	   recognizing a "-geom +0+0" argument.
09/11/91 - Making a new "tar" file for "3.1.2".  The only planned additional
	   change will be to copy back in the "troff" files for the release
	   notes.
-----------3.1.3 BEGINS HERE--------------------------------------------------
09/11/91 - Created "3.1.3" as a copy of "3.1.2".
09/12/91 - Copied in a new DECRISC binary for "rasview".
09/12/91 - Copied in a new Sun3 binary for "rasview".
09/13/91 - Copied in a new Cray binary for "rasview".
09/13/91 - Copied in a new SGI4D binary for "rasview".
09/16/91 - Updated all the files in "$NCARG/doc".
09/16/91 - Copied in a new RS6000 binary for "rasview".
09/16/91 - Copied in a new "$NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libictrans/lex.l"; this
	   fixes a problem with the use of the "alias" command in "ictrans".
09/16/91 - Copied in a new Sun4 binary for "rasview".
09/25/91 - Updated "pre2ncgm" to read the metafile using the correct set of
	   routines, so as to get around a problem on byte-swapped machines.
09/30/91 - Swapped in Don's new versions of "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/
	   bwi/wks.c.sed" and ".../wks.h".  The new routines use buffered
	   I/O and are supposed be more efficient on various machines, and
	   particularly on the Cray.  I tested the new scheme on "redcloud",
	   on "conundrum", and on "shavano", and found them to be working,
	   except for the ability to pipe the GKS output into a translator.
	   Don will provide me with new versions as he gets time to do so.
10/01/91 - Swapped in new versions of EZMAP and EZMAPA.  These need more
	   complete testing than I have given them so far, but I think they
	   are more robust that the previous versions.  In EZMAP, I changed
	   key sections of MAPINT and MAPTRN to use double precision; on
	   small machines, inaccuracies at the point opposite the center of
	   the projection were very large and caused serious problems for
	   EZMAPA.  In both packages, I changed the code that interpolates
	   points along great-circle paths in regions of great distortion so
	   as to use fewer points.  In EZMAPA, I streamlined the code that
	   puts the perimeter and the limb line in an area map and made it
	   executable even when the selected outline dataset is "NO"; I also
	   changed the radius of the perimeter used for projection types
	   "AE" and "LE" to match the effective radius implied by epsilon
	   tests in MAPTRN.  I got rid of some calls to Q8QST4 and changed
	   some sections of FORTRAN to use generic functions instead of
	   the old style functions.
10/08/91 - Updated the new EZMAP and EZMAPA to use double precision only on
	   machines on which it is needed.  Using it on the Cray proved to
	   be very expensive.
10/09/91 - Changed "ncargf77" and "ncargcc" to use "eval" to execute the
	   command string which has been built in a shell variable.  This
	   will make it possible to execute them with additional arguments
	   that contain double quotes, which has heretofore not been possible.
	   Also changed the "man" pages for these two commands.
10/09/91 - Changed "ncargex" (and "ncargtest", which is just a copy of it)
	   to use the suffix ".ncgm" instead of ".cgm".  This is as decided
	   by Fred, John, and others in a recent "email" exchange.
10/09/91 - Changed the names of the ".cgm" files in the directory "$NCARG/
	   ncarg2d/demo" to have the suffix ".ncgm" instead.
10/09/91 - Swapped in new versions of "wks.c.sed" and "wks.h.sed" (in the
	   directory "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/bwi"), updated the
	   "yMakefile" there to make "wks.h" from "wks.h.sed" and updated
	   all of the configuration files to include the new macro
	   "GKS_BUFFER_SIZE", which says how big the stream buffers are.
	   The addition of this macro will have to be documented in the
	   next release notes.
10/09/91 - Changed the "man" pages for "ncargex" and "ncargtest" to refer
	   to the ".ncgm" suffix instead of the ".cgm" suffix.
10/09/91 - Changed the default name of the parameter file (in configuration
	   files) from "params" to "ncargparams".
10/15/91 - Changed the "man" page for "ncargf77" to include a warning about
	   using the same options in preparing all the binary libraries.
10/15/91 - Swapped in new versions of "wks.c.sed" and "wks.h.sed" (in the
	   directory "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/bwi").  There are
	   still known problems with these routines, but they should be
	   better than what we had before.
10/16/91 - Removed a "printf" statement from the "mfio.c.sed" that was being
	   used by "cgmtrans".  This appears to be a debug statement that was
	   accidentally left in.
10/16/91 - Removed the same "printf" statement from the "mfio.c.sed" that was
	   being used by "pre2ncgm".
10/22/91 - Swapped in Don's latest versions of "wks.c.sed" and "wks.h.sed"
	   (in the directory "$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/bwi").
10/22/91 - Removed debug statements from the stuff I just swapped in.
10/25/91 - Updated CONPACK to fix a problem with the interaction between the
	   routines CPLBDR and CPPKLB which was causing incorrect labelling
	   on contour plots.
10/29/91 - Fixed a bug in the last CONPACK update.  CPLBDR had been changed
	   so as not to call CPPKLP to pick label positions.
10/30/91 - Fixed another bug in CONPACK.  Changed the routine CPTRCL to
	   prevent the generation of two identical points in the polyline
	   representing a contour line.  This had been causing problems in
	   various ways.
11/04/91 - Removed the files "$NCARG/ncarg2d/man/ncargmac.p" and "...mac3.p",
	   which were zero-length files created by the attempt to preprocess
	   the associated ".m" files.
11/07/91 - Updated the graphcaps in "$NCARG/common/src/graphcap".  The
	   PostScript graphcaps have been changed to remove encoding of
	   leading blank for coordinate pairs.
11/18/91 - Fixed an "error" in the AREAS routine ARPRAM.  The interpolation
	   of points on too-long line segments was being done in such a way
	   that the drawing order of the endpoints made a difference.  This
	   was undesirable.
11/19/91 - Fixed an error in the new double-precision code in EZMAP.
11/19/91 - Fixed an error in AWI which was causing a CLIP INDICATOR to be put
	   out between an END PICTURE and a BEGIN PICTURE when a GSCLIP call
	   was the first call in a picture subsequent to the first.
11/20/91 - Fixed a bug in the CONPACK routine CPTRCL, which traces contour
	   lines.  In certain cases, the spline smoother was returning a
	   smoothed curve which did not have exactly the same endpoints as
	   the unsmoothed input curve.  This would sometimes cause color
	   fill of contour bands to fail.
11/22/91 - Took an unnecessary clause out of IF tests in CPCLAM, CPCLDM, and
	   CPCLDR.  Created a new routine CPCLTR, which serves as a user
	   interface to CPTRCL.
11/22/91 - Changed the AREAS routine ARSCAM so that it no longer bombs on
	   "algorithm failure" when the presence of a degenerate sub-area
	   having zero width causes the list of area identifiers for that
	   sub-area to be incomplete; now, such sub-areas are simply ignored.
11/26/91 - Changed the configuration file for the Cray to get rid of what
	   appear to be unnecessary quotes in the definitions of LD_CFLAGS
	   and LD_FFLAGS.
12/05/91 - Added the new routine MAPTRI to EZMAP.  It does the inverse
	   transformations.
12/09/91 - Added a new example for EZMAP, demonstrating the use of the new
	   routine MAPTRI.  It has become "mpex10" and what was "mpex10" has
	   become "mpexfi".  Both the script "ncargex" and the "man" page for
	   it have been updated to reflect the changes.
12/10/91 - Fixed a minor problem in the new EZMAP example.
12/13/91 - "Changed" the GRIDAL routine "grid.f" by typing a blank over a
	   blank (I suppose a "touch" would have sufficed) and then did a
	   "make install".  This was done as a test and should have had no
	   substantive effect on the installed libraries, but just in case ...
12/18/91 - Updated the script "ncargf77" to recognize "-dashline" and
	   "-dashchar" (which the "man" pages claimed that they did) and
	   do the appropriate thing.
01/03/92 - Updated EZMAP and EZMAPA to correct, in various ways, the handling
	   of the satellite-view transformation.
01/07/92 - Made a nonsense comment change in AREAS for purposes of
	   demonstrating updates.
01/16/92 - Added conditional code to "pre2ncgm" to effect byte-reversal on
	   DEC Stations; removed occurances of "360" in the executable
	   code in favor of MNWRDS.
01/21/92 - Added the Longs Peak example as an example for SRFACE.
	   It has become "srex01".  Both the script "ncargex" and
	   the "man" page for it have been updated to reflect the
	   changes.
01/22/92 - Removed "ncargtest" and all references to it from the
	   distribution since it was identical to "ncargex".
01/22/92 - Simplified example 10 for EZMAP.
01/24/92 - Update the PostScript graphcaps to include a setting of 10
           for the software fill line spacing.
02/03/92 - Updated ymake-filter.c so that it doesn't turn Saber-C
	   commented makefile rules into normal comments that Saber-C
	   would ignore.
02/07/92 - Changed what happens to the area identifiers for coincident
	   line segments belonging to the same group. 
02/13/92 - Updated the Configure script to prompt for the location of
	   X11 libraries and include files.  Also had to change the
	   config file for each system to support the changes to 
	   Configure.
02/14/92 - Updated the config files to include a VERSION macro.  This
	   required adding a new file called "version" that just has
	   the version number.
02/14/92 - Updated "change.copyright" script to update the version
	   numbers in each configuration file.  Renamed "change.copyright"
	   to "update_version"
02/18/92 - Updated the "ncargcc" script file to include proper libraries
	   for DECstations, SGIs, and Sun4s.
02/20/92 - Updated HPUX config file to include proper location for X
	   libraries and include files.  Changed configure script
	   so it didn't try to second-guess pathnames of app-defaults
	   directory.
02/21/92 - Changed SET calls so that clipping will be done on graphic 
	   output done by the user routine; allow for user specification 
	   of color indices used by debugging rtn.
02/21/92 - Changed the Sun3 config file to have the proper pathnames
	   for the library, binary, and man page directory.
02/21/92 - Took the "X11R3" macro out of the RS6000 config file since
	   it doesn't apply anymore.
02/21/92 - Changed code in AREAS to indicate connecting lines for holes.
02/23/92 - Copied over new NCAR View from John Clyne
02/25/92 - Copied over two new NCAR View files:
            $NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libctrans/ctrans.c
            $NCARg/ncarview/src/lib/libcgm/cgmdef.h
02/28/92 - Copied over new versions of $NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libctrans
           and $NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libncarg_ras
03/01/92 - Copied over $NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libctrans.  Includes new
	   features in ctrans for TAGS. 
03/02/92 - Changed the encoding of a string in GFLASH to make it more 
	   portable.
03/02/92 - Changed code in libncarg_gks/bwi to not copy background color
	   to segments.
03/02/92 - Added the example "arex01" to the examples suite.  Changed
	   "ncargex" and the man page for "ncargex" to reflect this 
	   addition.
03/06/92 - Changed some routines in CONPACK to fix bugs and do hachuring 
	   and all the changes growing out of the new inverse transfor-
	   mations in EZMAP.  This included added some new routines so
	   the yMakefile was updated accordingly.
03/06/92 - Removed "Dummy.f" and "dummy.f" from $NCARG/ncarg2d/src/db/ezmap.
03/10/92 - Fixed "ncargex" to print out more consistent messages.
03/11/92 - In response to a bug found in med, a new version of
           $NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libcgm/meta_edit.c was copied over.
03/12/92 - Added some C compiler options to $NCARG/config/SGI4D to force
	   a Kernigan and Ritchie style compiler (default is ANSI).
03/12/92 - Copied over a new libcgm to fix some more bugs found in med.
03/12/92 - Copied over a list of bug fixes for NCAR View and put in
	   $NCARV/ncarview/RELEASE.  Need to get something similar for
	   rest of NCAR Graphics.
03/17/92 - Changed $NCARG/ncarview/src/bin/scripts/Makefile to correct 
	   error in processing "fcaps".
03/17/92 - Copied over ~clyne/$NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libictrans/ictrans.c
	   since it had a slightly different date in the header.
03/18/92 - Copied over ~clyne/ncarg3.1.3/ncarview/src/lib/libcgm to fix
	   a bug in med.
03/18/92 - Copied over ~don/src/ymake-filter/ymake to fix bugs with Saber-C
	   directives in the yMakefiles on the Cray and RS6000.
03/18/92 - Added "#BuildUnsupportedAthenaApplications" to HPUX config file.
03/18/92 - Changed the C compiler options in $NCARG/config/SGI4D .
03/19/92 - Copied over new yMakefile from ~clyne/ncarg3.1.3/ncarview/src/
	   lib/libictrans to fix bug in ncargf77 -ictrans on HP and RS6000.
03/20/92 - Took "-I/usr/local/include/bsd" out of the SGI4D config file.
03/20/92 - Changed $NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/bwi/wks.c.sed to call
	   "fork" and not "vfork" if on SGI.
03/20/92 - Copied over a new rasview from John.  rasview can now display
	   indexed or true-color imagery on either indexed or true-color
	   X servers, i.e.  the DEC server.
03/23/92 - Copied over $NCARG/ncarview/src/lib/libcgm/{misc.c,cgm_tools.c}
	   from John Clyne to fix problems with med on the Cray.
03/23/92 - Copied over idt,rasview,cgm_edit binaries from all machines.
03/23/92 - In CONPACK, changed all occurrences of the constant "8000" to 
	   "2500" in the routine CPTRVE.  This has the effect of reducing
	   the precision with which the routine generates the visible/
	   invisible boundary going into the area map.  (It will therefore
	   use less space in the area map and CONPACK example 8 will no 
	   longer blow out because the area map array is too small.)  At 
	   the same time, put a "C" in column 1 of a blank comment line 
	   in the new routine CPWLAM; the code itself was not changed.
03/24/92 - Turned off optimization in AREAS and CONPACK for SGI4D to
	   fix problems with AREAS and CONPACK examples.
03/24/92 - Fixed "ncargmv" and "ncargtar" to reflex additions to examples
	   and binaries.
03/25/92 - In CONPACK, fixed CPTRVE to fix a problem that arose when the 
	   mapped edge of the data grid was wholly contained within the 
	   visible/invisible edge.
03/25/92 - Updated files in $NCARG/doc and $NCARG/ncarview/doc.
03/27/92 - Copied over a new MAPTRN routine to EZMAP to fix some
	   bugs found on shavano in the examples mpex04, mpex07, and
	   mpexfi.
03/30/92 - Made tarfile of version 3.1.3.
04/02/92 - Swapped in new rn.toc and rn.txt because of HP correction.
04/02/92 - Made new tarfile of 3.1.3.
04/03/92 - Copied in new $NCARG/ncarview/src/bin/idt/talkto.c from John
	   to fix bug with "Print" button.
