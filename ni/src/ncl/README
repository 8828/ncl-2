1. There are weird problems with the "markers.ncl" script in
ncargtest/nclscripts/plotting on some systems (seems to be with Linux
systems running gcc4, so far). On jupiter, compiling HLUFunctions.c
with optimization turned off makes it work.  The last line of the
following script was causing a "fatal:Execute: Error occurred at or
near line 15 in file script.ncl" error. (This is due to the "(/34/)"
syntax. If I remove the "(/" and "/)" it works):

appid = create "app" appClass defaultapp end create
wks   = create "ps" psWorkstationClass defaultapp end create

letter = "u"
xoff   = 0.0
yoff   = 0.0
ratio  = 1.0
size   = 1.0
angle  = 90

new_markers = NhlNewMarker(wks,letter,(/34/),xoff,yoff,ratio,size,angle)

2. For same system as above, I also had to turn off optimization for
"lib/hlu/Format.c" because it would cause the "tm04n.ncl" example to
not generate the correct graphic.
